### Acknowledgements

The core backbone of this project is the Hazel Engine by the Engineer who is know as TheCherno. How this differs from the mainline would be my attempt at learning other APIs to implement their backend on the same mainline such as a DirectX or Vulcan, additional modifications and tweaks to the build scripts and pipelines as I see fit to the best of my knowledge as well.
